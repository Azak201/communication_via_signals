ðŸ“¡ Minitalk â€“ Interprocess Communication with Unix Signals in C

Built a lightweight client-server communication system in C, using Unix signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2) to transmit data bit by bit between processes. This project demonstrates low-level interprocess communication without using sockets or pipes.

ðŸ”§ Project Highlights:
â€¢ Implemented a server that receives characters encoded in binary via signals
â€¢ Developed a client that converts each character to binary and sends it to the server
â€¢ Handled signal synchronization, bit reconstruction, and message termination
â€¢ Explored signal queuing and process ID (PID) management
â€¢ Ensured stability and correctness even under rapid signal dispatch

ðŸ›  Technologies & Skills:
â€¢ C programming
â€¢ Unix signals (SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2)
â€¢ Bitwise operations and binary data handling
â€¢ Interprocess communication (IPC)
â€¢ Signal safety and synchronization in Linux environments

This project deepened my understanding of how processes can communicate in a constrained, low-level system, and taught me how to think creatively with minimal tools.
